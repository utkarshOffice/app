      influence of sealing parameters (dwell time, temperature, pressure) on seal strength

      The model development is performed based on a Design of Experiment (DOE) dataset and using 
      various machine learning algorithms for regression analysis.
      This is an automated model development workflow where the user simply needs to upload the DOE dataset.
      Once the regression analysis is complete, the application compares the performance of the different 
      algorithms and allows the user to select the best one.
