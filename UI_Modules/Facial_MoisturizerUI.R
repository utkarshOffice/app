The process of making L63 is challenging as it is not a traditional oil in water emulsification reaction. There are 4 main phases in making L63, heating, first stage emulsification, second stage emulsification and cooling. During the emulsification phase, homogenization speed and time length are controlled to ensure a good emulsification and well mixing of powders. During the cooling phase, cooling rate and shear rate are controlled to ensure the formation of lamellar structure and a smooth appearance. "),

JMP was used to generate the DoE plan. DMP data, including material, sensor and quality data were captured during the trial running. PAE was used for DoE model development and exploration. PAE multi-sampling feature was used to split a single trial into multiple sub trials based on the sample taken. There was a total of 12 pilot plant trials in this study (Table 2). "),

Segmentation of the sensor data was mainly based on the signals of main mixer temperature, main recycle flow meter, in-line homogenization speed and main recycle temperature. 

After segmentation, viscosity 2hrs and viscosity 24hrs were selected as responses, key processing parameters at corresponding phases: 2 Homo I PT100 (oC) Mean, 3 Homo II Silverson (Hz) Mean, 2 Homo I Length, 3 Homo II Length, 5 Cooling I Length, 6 Cooling II Length, 7 Discharge IFM temp (oC) Mean and 7 Discharge Length were selected as factors to build the model.

As we observed in the sensitivity analysis (Figure 2, Figure 4), homogenization speed is a critical variable in the determination of both viscosity 2hrs and viscosity 24hrs. An increase in the homogenization speed is predicted to yield an increase in product viscosity. Specific to viscosity 2hrs, discharge temperature, initial emulsification temperature and second homogenization time length are also significant factors, while the viscosity 24hrs are affected by the changes in discharge temperature, first homogenization time length and first cooling time length. Itâ€™s worth noting that an increase in discharge temperature is predicted to yield an increase in viscosity 2hrs, while a decrease in viscosity 24hrs. "),
